# LPG-Gas-Detection-and-Monitoring-System

## The Problem 
Gas leaks pose a serious threat, leading to explosions, fires, and carbon monoxide poisoning. Early detection is crucial for preventing tragedies.

## Our Solution
We built a system that continuously monitors for LPG leaks using a reliable MQ6 gas sensor. The sensor relays data to a PIC16F877A microcontroller, which analyzes the readings and calculates the LPG     concentration in parts per million (PPM).

### Key Features
#### Real-time PPM display: 
    The system showcases the detected LPG concentration on a clear LCD display, making it easy to monitor gas levels.
#### Bluetooth connectivity: 
    Connect the system to your smartphone via HC-05 Bluetooth module for remote monitoring and alerts.
#### Customizable alarms: 
    Set programmable alarm thresholds based on safety guidelines. The system triggers visual and audible alerts once LPG levels exceed safe limits.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Software & Hardware

#### Coding: 
    We programmed the system using Micro C, ensuring efficient and accurate data processing.
#### Circuit Design: 
    The system's hardware schematic was meticulously designed using Proteus simulation software.
    
### üí° Impact: 
    This project goes beyond academics. It offers a practical solution for enhancing home safety and potentially saving lives. We're proud to have contributed to a project with such real-world impact.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps: 
We're excited to explore further development possibilities, such as integrating smart home automation features for automatic gas valve shut-off or emergency response notification.
